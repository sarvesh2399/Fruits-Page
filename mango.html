            Mango, known as the "king of fruits," is not only a delicious tropical delight but also a nutritional
            powerhouse. Packed with essential vitamins and minerals, mangoes offer a wide array of health benefits. Rich
            in vitamin C, A, and E, mangoes contribute to a robust immune system, healthy skin, and good vision. The
            presence of dietary fiber aids in digestion, promoting a healthy gut. Mangoes also contain beta-carotene,
            which is beneficial for maintaining cardiovascular health.
